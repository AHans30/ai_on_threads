# AI/ML accounts on Threads

[Here](http://raw.githack.com/aletheap/ai_on_threads/main/ai_accounts_on_threads.html) is a searchable, sortable list of names, affiliations, and Twitter -> Threads handle mappings.

If you follow some of these accounts, it should help get your recommendations bootstrapped so Threads can then help you find more AI/ML people.

If you study or work in AI/ML, and you'd like to add yourself to the list, just submit a PR modifying the [source.csv](source.csv) file.
