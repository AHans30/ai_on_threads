# AI on Threads

[This](ai_accounts_on_threads.csv) is a list of AI accounts on Meta's new Threads app with mappings from Twitter handles to Threads handles. If you follow some of these accounts, it should help get your recommendations bootstrapped so Threads can then help you find more people. Credit to @chrisalbon and @mattlynley for assembling the first versions of this list. If you work in AI and have a threads account, please feel free to submit a PR to add yourself to this list.
